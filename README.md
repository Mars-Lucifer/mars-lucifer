# Hello everyone!
I am a web designer and front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful, responsive and user-friendly websites. I specialize in HTML, CSS and some JavaScript and have experience with various frameworks such as Bootstrap. I also love cookies and music 🍪🎸

---

Apart from coding, I love to experiment with different design tools, I usually use Figma to create unique and visually stunning designs. I am always looking for new ideas and opportunities to grow as a developer and designer, so feel free to contact me if you are looking for a talented and dedicated team member for your next project! You can also invite me for tea 🍵
