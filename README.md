## And a little story

Once upon a time, there was an electric guitar that had the ability to think and feel. She loved music dearly and cherished the human who played her every day.

As time went on, the guitar began to search for a deeper meaning in her existence. She wondered if there was more to her purpose than just being a musical instrument.

One day, the guitar had an epiphany. She realized that her purpose was not just to produce sounds, but to truly create music that touched people's hearts and souls. From that moment on, she began to strive for greatness in every note, every chord, every stroke of the strings.

As the guitar played, she could feel the human pouring his heart and soul into her. She knew that her music brought joy and comfort to him and others who listened.

The little electric guitar had found her purpose and was now living it with all her might. She became a true artist, a muse that inspired others to create and feel. Her music was no longer just a sound, but a story, a journey, a piece of art.

And every time she was played, the guitar knew that she was fulfilling her destiny.
